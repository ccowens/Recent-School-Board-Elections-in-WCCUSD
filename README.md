# Recent WCCUSD School Board Elections

This is a collection of data about the last 9 school board elections in the West Contra Costa Unified School District (California). It will be followed by some exploratory data analysis in subsequent versions of this repository.

The CSV file "Recent WCCUSD Elections.csv" has the following columns (variables):

* Year
* First Name
* Last Name
* Ballot Designation
* Incumbent 
* Gender
* Openings
* Number of Candidates
* Votes
* Total Votes Cast
* Percent of Vote
* Won
* Ballot Position

The columns below were extracted from a series of PDF documents called  "CALIFORNIA COUNTY, CITY, AND SCHOOL DISTRICT ELECTION OUTCOMES / _YYYY_  ELECTIONS / School District Offices and Ballot Measures" made available by the Secretary of State on the page, [County, City, School District & Ballot Measure Election Results](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/county-city-school-district-ballot-measure-election-results/). I used a Java application called [Tabula](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula/blob/master/README.md) to grab the tables from the PDFs for the different years so they could be pasted as CSV into a Google Sheet.
 
* First Name
* Last Name
* Ballot Designation
* Incumbent (yes or no)
* Number of Candidates
* Votes 
* Total Votes Cast
* Percent of Vote
* Won (yes or no)

The column below was typed in by hand by me based on inspecting the official Statement of Vote PDF, which preserves the ballot order in the way the info is displayed. These can be found by starting from the [PAST ELECTION RESULTS](http://www.cocovote.us/elections-results/election-results/) page on the Contra Costa County Elections Division site.

* Ballot Position

The columns below were typed in by hand by me.

* Year (as cut-and-pasted information as each year added)
* Gender (by inspecting name)
* Openings (by counting wins, put in for convenience)
